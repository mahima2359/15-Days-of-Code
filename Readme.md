  # DAY 1 (13/10/2025)
  --> QUESTION 1. Aggressive Cows PROBLEM(BINARY SEARCH) SOLVED IN TUF SHEET/gfg
   problem link: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/aggressive-cows/1
   NOTE : I solved it using biary search on answers. First, I sorted the stall positions and then used binary search to find the largest minimum distance possible between any two cows. For each middle distance,     I checked if all cows could be placed keeping at least that much gap. If yes, I tried a larger distance; otherwise I reduced it.
  --> QUESTION 2. BOOK ALLOCATION PROBLEM (solved in gfg)
   problem link: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/allocate-minimum-number-of-pages0937/1
   NOTE: I solved it using binary search on answers. I searched for the minimum possible maximum pages a student can read by checking each middle value. For each mid, I counted how many students would be needed     if no one reads more than that many pages. If it was possible within k students, I tried a smaller maximum; otherwise, I increased it.
   --> QUESTION 3. Split array - Largest Sum(solved in leetcode)
   solution link: https://leetcode.com/submissions/detail/1800459934/
   NOTE: I solved it using binary search on answers. I searched for the minimum possible largest sum among subarrays by checking each middle value. For each mid, I calculated how many subarrays would be needed      if no subarray sum exceeded that value. If it was possible within k subarrays, I tried a smaller maximum; otherwise I increased it.
   -->QUESTION 4. Painter's partition(SOLVED IN GFG)
   solution link: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/the-painters-partition-problem1535/1
   NOTE: I solved it using binary search on answers. I searched for the minimum time required by checking each middle value as a possible limit. For each mid, I calculated how many workers would be needed if no     one exceeded that time. If it was possible within k workers, I tried a smaller limit; otherwise I increased it.
